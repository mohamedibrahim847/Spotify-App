# Spotify-App
Uses spotify API to fetch and display user stats as well as creating playlists based on already liked songs.
App.js file sets the main server and includes logic for handling Spotify OAuth and routes to each link
all ejs files set up the rednering of dyanmic htmls based on spotify requested data
styles.css sets up style for each page to allow for more customization
index.html is the original page with a login link - currently unfinished 
playlist creation feature is theoretically functional although I've been having issues with getting capped by the spotify API for doing too many requests - need to request extention
top track, top artists, top albums, listening insights dashboard all complete and display user's personal listening data as requested from spotify
